            Starting with video game publishing for Windows PCs, releasing titles such as Microsoft Flight Simulator and Age of Empires, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates wanted to enter the video game console industry. This was due to Gates seeing the PS2 as a trheat to Windows PCs, as he believed the PS2 had enough capabilities to make Windows PCs irrelevant. Before entering solo, Microsoft asked both Sony and Nintendo to help with console development, with Microsoft even offering to buy Nintendo entirely, though Nintendo declined to even meet with Microsoft. In 1998, members of the DirectX team at Microsoft had put together a prototype that Microsoft eventually invested resources into in order to make a new console. The Xbox was officially announced by Gates at GDC 2000, and was publicly showcased by Gates and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson at CES 2001 alongside launch titles like Dead or Alive 3 and Xbox mascot franchise Halo. The Xbox finally launched on Nivember 15th, 2001 in North America.

                Psychonauts
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                    With great comedy and a unique artstyle inspired by Tim Burton, Psychonauts takes place at a summer camp where young psychics can hone their abilities. With great platforming challenges and a great overall tone, Psychonauts is a fantastic game more people should play, as not many people had played or even heard of it before the sequel was announced in 2015.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller is another hidden gem created by Sega, where players are tasked with dropping people around fictionalized versions of New York City and Las Vegas off at their desired destinations. The premise is encased within an addicting arcade game that one could spend hours playing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Panzer Dragoon: Orta
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  Another Sega exclusive on the Xbox, Panzer Dragoon: Orta is the last game in the Panzer Dragoon series, and is a great game to end on. With great set pieces, this rail shooter is incredibly beautiful and fun, as well as challenging, to play. This game also comes with the original Panzer Dragoon as an unlockable extra, which is great for returning fans.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Ninja Gaiden: Black
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  A challenging, yet addicting, 3D hack-and-slash with varying setpieces and great boss battles. Akthough this game can feel overwhelming with challenge, players that are interested should definitely stick with it and overcome this rewarding game.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Jet Set Radio: Future
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  With a fantastic artstyle, some of the best video game music ever created, and being yet another Sega game, this Xbox launch title is a great 3D platformer with a great premise, which is that players play as one of many members of a graffiti gang, where you have to out-graffiti competing gangs, and eventually save your fellow gang members.
                </li>

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p class = "legtxt">
            The original Xbox is known as the most powerful console of the sixth generation of consoles, with most multi-platform games playing best on Xbox, such as Psychonauts. The Xbox is also known as the console that caused Rare Ltd. to leave Nintendo, as Microsoft bought Rare Ltd. entirely after Nintendo declined to buy Rare after being requested to. Possibly the greatest contribution the original Xbox made to the gaming industry is possibly the popularization of online gaming with Xbox Live, as this service (starting with Halo 2) made players demand most games to have online multiplayer functuonality after the success Halo 2 had with its integration.
