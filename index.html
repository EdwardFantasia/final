                In the late 90s, Sega released their final console, the Dreamcast, and began the sixth generation of consoles. Following the Dreamcast, the
                <a class = "link" id = "ps2" href = "ps2.html">Playstation 2</a> released, and would eventually become the best selling video game of all time. Shortly after the Playstation 2, the <a class = "link" id = "gamecube" href = "gamecube.html">Nintendo Gamecube</a> would release and would ultimately come in third place in the console race during this generation and would ultimately change Nintendo's stance on console development forever. Finally, in 2004, Microsoft released the final major console of the sixth generation, the <a class = "link" id = "xbox" href = "xbox.html">Xbox,</a> and would end up second to the Playstation 2, but was not able sell anywhere near the Playstation 2's lofty sales numbers. The sixth generation would also end an era for Sega, as after the Dreamcast's failure to sell after the launch of the Playstation 2, they would become a third-party publisher and publish games for the now three major consoles.
