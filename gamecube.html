            Beginning in 1998 with ArtX working on the system logic design and graphics processor (codenamed Flipper), Nintendo announced the Gamecube in May 1999 with the name Project Dolphin. Around this time, IBM had also formed a partnership with Nintendo to create the Gamecube's CPU, the Gekko. On August 25th, 2000, the official name of Project Dolphin, the Gameube. At E3 2001, 15 games were showcased to show people the power of the Gamecube, which included Luigi's manison and Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader, alongside a marketing campaign that would end up costing Nintendo $76 million. On May 21, 2001, the launch price of the Gamecube was revealed to be $200 for each unit, which was $100 less than the PS2. Finally, on September 14th, 2001, the Gamecube launched in Japan, and on November 18th, 2001, the Gamecube launched in North America.

            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                    The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a 3D action adventure game in the Legend of Zelda series. Complete with a darker atmosphere due to the negative backlash of the the cel-shaded artstyle of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess has some of the best dungeon puzzles and dungeon design in general in the entire series.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Metroid Prime 1
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  Being the first 3D Metroid game in the series, Metroid Prime 1 could have been a definite failure in design, however, Retro Studios made one of the best designed Metroid games, with great controls, fantastic music, and a dark and forboding planet to explore known as Tallon IV.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour is both a fantastic singleplayer and multiplayer game, with different modes such as ring attack and score attack both offering multiplayer and singleplayer variations. Characters can also be unlocked by playing different modes in-game.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Super Mario Sunshine
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  Although a very flawed and janky game when discussing its physics and level design (in some regards), Super Mario Sunshine has some of the most fun platforming mechanics, as well as one of the best hub worlds of any 3D platformer. The tropical theme of the entire game is also fantastic for a playthrough any time of the year when it is heating up outside.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>
              Luigi's Mansion
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li class = "listtext">
                  As a Gamecube launch title, Luigi's Mansion still holds up very well. Luigi's Mansion is a fantastic showcase for the Gamecube's graphical prowess, showing off very dynamic lighting and great gameplay.
                </li>

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p class = "legtxt">
            By the end of the Gamecube's lifespan, the Gamecube was Nintendo's worst-selling home console (selling 21.75 million units), with it now being the second-worst after the end of the Wii U's lifecycle. However, the lasting legacy of the Gamecube is the number of quality exclusives that were released and not properly appreciated when they were originally released. As a result of this lack of appreciation at release and current appreciation, not many copies of many games were sold, and thus are very expensive to buy second-had. Fortunately, one of the best emulators available online is known as the Dolphin emulator, which allows gaming enthusiasts to play a copy of any Gamecube or Wii game  they desire on their personal computer if they are able to find an ISO file online or from a friend.
