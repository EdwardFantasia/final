            Reportedly beginning development around the launch of the Playstation 1 in late 1994 with father of Playstation, Ken Kutaragi, heading development, reports of the Playstation 2 being in development officially began in 1997. Around the times of said reports, it was being discussed that included features of the PS2 would include built-in DVD player and internet connectivity, two innovative features of consoles at the time. Sony eventually officially announced the Playstation 2 on March 1st, 1999 after over a year of denying its existence. At Tokyo Game Show 1999, Sony revealed the release date of the PS2, as well as tech demos to display the power of the PS2. The Playstation 2 finally released in Japan on March 4th, 2000 in Japan, and October 26th, 2000.

                <li class = "listtext">
                  Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence is my personal favorite game of all time. Great stealth mechanics, as well as a crazy and complex, yet emotional, story elevate this game to an entirely different level. An absolute must play for all PS2 owners.

                  Kingdom Hearts 2 is an incredible action RPG set in the worlds of Disney and containing characters from the Final Fantasy franchise. Although the story and concept can seem bizarre, Kingdom Hearts 2 has very heartfelt moments within its story, as well as extremely satisfying combat. Another must play for PS2 owners.

                  Ape Escape 3 is a 3D platformer with a bizarre concept: you, the player, must capture monkeys that have been mind-controlled by a white monkey named Specter. The player will go through many worlds to capture these monkeys and eventually defeat Specter.

                <li class = "listtext">
                  Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is the sequel to the innovative stealth game Metal Gear Solid on the original Playstation. The game has been a controversial title for many, as players are forced to play as Raiden instead of the original game's protagonist, Snake. However, players have come around with Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, realizing that besides not being able to play as Snake, the game is a great stealth game with a great story and fantastic level design based on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, adding to the atmosphere of isolation.

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p class = "legtxt">
            The Playstation 2 has had a long-lasting legacy. The Playstation 2 led Sony to becoming the leader of the gaming industry through the sixth generation, as the PS2s inclusion of a DVD media player made it more attractive to purchase than just a normal DVD player, as a PS2 could play both video games and DVDs instead of just DVDs. The PS2 also led Sony to getting a bit cocky when developing the Playstation 3, as the creation of the Cell Processor and its inclusion of said processor in the PS3 was due to Sony's thought process that all developers would learn its architecture because they were in first place. This, however, would not turn in Sony's favor, as developers decided to instead prioritze the Xbox 360, and thus the Xbox 360 sold more at the beginning of the seventh console generation. However, the Playstation 2's most notable accolade is that it is the highest selling video game system of all time, selling more than 155 million units in its lifetime, and still attracts players across the world via retro game stores to play its incredible library of exclusive titles. This attraction to the PS2 also led to the PS2 having one of the longest lifespans of any console ever made, with Sony ending production of the PS2 on January 4th, 2014, almost 13 years after it launched in 2002.
